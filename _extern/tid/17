State-sharing trackers WILL have swarm data that has over 90% overlap within the tier (it takes lab conditions to get 100% overlap)</p><p>I provide one of the trackers used in OpenOffice.org&#039;s bittorrent system, and I also run my own independent tier of trackers.</p><p>The way the original specification was written, if a multitracker torrent does have multiple trackers in a single tier, it is to be assumed that there is state sharing. A tracker in a given tier that responds is to be &quot;locked on to&quot; for the duration of the session (or until it fails to respond on an announce cycle, then it goes to the next one).</p>]]></content>

		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I would like this BEP to have a section on tracker state semantics. It is clear, when you begin implementing the tracker part of the bitorrent protocol, that there is a stateful semantics in the &#039;event&#039; field of tracker GET requests.</p><p>It is pretty obvious what should happen if there is only a single tracker, as you can only prod the state of that single tracker. In the case of multiple trackers, however, it is far from obvious what the correct semantics are: it is highly dependent on how state sharing is done, if it is done at all.</p><p>In any case, even if there is only one plausible way, I think it should be stated explicitly what a client should do. Or we may end up having slightly different interpretations.</p>]]></content>

If there is and PEX is properly implemented the swarms will merge pretty fast. low-profile DHT tracking for multifiletorrents, with a DHT-announce probability based on the swarm size reported by the tracker should be sufficient to create such merging.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>I&#039;m not aware of any other state-sharing trackers.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>Oh... just everything that runs on opentracker, which includes TPB, denis.stalker and various special-interest trackers.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>Regardless of how we document url-list semantics in a BEP, it is unlikely to change user behavior.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>Well, ÂµTs multitracker editor is particularly inviting for that. Adding tiered trackers should be more &quot;complicated&quot; (regarding the # of clicks/keystrokes involved) than adding backup/non-sharing trackers.</p>]]></content>

		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>right, if you throw &quot;DHT tracking when the seed+peer count is low&quot;-behavior into the mix then PEX should be able to merge swarms from various trackers and announcing to multiple trackers at once is just unnecessary load.</p><p>One might argue that announcing to seperate trackers does not add extra load to the individual trackers.
