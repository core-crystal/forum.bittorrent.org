The PREFER keyword could also be replaced by a mark-up of the rules that&#039;s preferred, say by prefixing it with a &#039;+&#039; for instance.

Maybe to have a bencoded response saying that &quot;not a tracker HOSTNAME:PORT&quot;, that can be easily served as static files to allow sites to permanently store a DENY for (HTTP) tracker connections to it.</p><p>&quot;It would certainly help a lot if a tracker failure on one torrent backed off attempts across all jobs as well.&quot; - Yes!</p>]]></content>

		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>one things clients could do is to treat 404 as &quot;never try this again&quot;.. Unfortunately, I think it&#039;s quite common that actual trackers to frequently 404 as well, so it may not be a good indicator. It would be nice to find some reliable indicator of a server just being a plain web server, not intended for running a tracker. If a sysadmin needs to take action when this happens you&#039;ve already bumped the hassle up, and I can&#039;t imagine it&#039;s makes that much difference *what* the sysadmin has to do. Running a small UDP responder that says &quot;interval: &lt;INT_MAX&gt;&quot; may not be that different from having to set up a TXT record for the domain (assuming that whoever abused the server used a hostname).</p><p>I&#039;ve seen trackers fail with an HTML response body, which is especially bad, since it makes it look like it&#039;s not intended to run a tracker.</p><p>As for bep31, a more reliable solution is to send a very large &quot;min interval&quot; response, and it already works with essentially every client.</p>]]></content>

		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wonder if it&#039;s possible to simplify the rules specified in the TXT record. For instance, how is this supposed to be interpreted:</p><p>&quot;BTTRACKER ALLOW TCP:80&quot;</p><p>Does it mean I&#039;m not allowed to connect to any other port than 80? Am I allowed to connect to any port over UDP? Or is this just a non-sensical statement?</p><p>Personally I&#039;m a fan of allowing concise statements. This could be possible by having a well defined default. Say, anything that isn&#039;t specified as allowed, should be considered denied. Obviously with the exception that if there&#039;s no BTTRACKER TXT record, everything should be considered allowed.</p><p>I&#039;m guessing that the most common use case would be to disallow everything except for the few services that are running. In which case denying all by default would make sense.</p><p>Another case that isn&#039;t well defined is when evaluation is terminated. From the examples, it looks like evaluation of expressions are evaluated in order of their apparence, from left to right. And evaluation is terminated when the current connection attempt is either allowed or denied, or there are no more rules (in which case I guess it&#039;s allowed?). The PREFER statement is an exception here though. It&#039;s not entirely clear what a client should do with that. Say UDP is preferred, but doesn&#039;t work. A client that rewrites any http:// to udp:// would break in that case, i.e. you would need much more complicated logic to deal with that.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that there needs to be a convenient internal representation of this rule-set as well. There should be a clear mapping to something like a port-filter. I&#039;m envisioning an internal representation of two port-filter lists (i.e. non-overlapping port-ranges defining allowed and disallowed ports). One for TCP and one for UDP.</p><p>This representation would be simplified if the DENY keyword was removed and everything was assumed to be denied unless explicitly allowed. The PREFER keyword could also be replaced by a mark-up of the rules that&#039;s preferred, say by prefixing it with a &#039;+&#039; for instance. If the PREFER and DENY kewords are both removed, there&#039;s no need to say &quot;ALLOW&quot; either. We would get more well-defined semantics and shorter rules.</p><p>For instance, one of examples; &quot;BTTRACKER ALLOW UDP:80 DENY TCP&quot; is unclear whether it allows UDP packets on ports other than 80.</p><p>One more thing, how about saying &quot;BITTORRENT&quot; instead of &quot;BTTRACKER&quot;? It creates a nice symmetry with the peer-protocol which also uses BitTorrent in the hand-shake, and it suggests that this belongs to the bittorrent protocol, and it doesn&#039;t contain an acronym.</p><p>Here are the examples from the BEP with the syntax I&#039;m suggesting:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>www.website.com. IN TXT &quot;BITTORRENT&quot;
tracker.somedomain.com. IN TXT &quot;BITTORRENT +UDP:80 TCP:80&quot;
udponlytracker.somedomain.com. IN TXT &quot;BITTORRENT UDP:80&quot;
httpstracker.adomain.com. IN TXT &quot;BITTORRENT TCP:80 TCP:443&quot;</code></pre></div><p>The first one is unfortunately not very intuitive. I wonder how common it would be though.</p><p>This is sort of a brain dump of my impression reading and thinking about this BEP proposal. I&#039;m interested in what others think.</p>]]></content>
