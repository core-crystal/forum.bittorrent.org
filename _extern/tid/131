		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ghazel&gt; That&#039;s not true. Larger packets take longer to send, which results <br />ghazel&gt; in a slower reaction to congestion. Smaller packets at lower speeds were chosen <br />ghazel&gt; specifically after measuring the impact on congestion controller responsiveness.<br />In &quot;link-local&quot; scale that&#039;s somewhat correct. So, you solved one particular congestion problem: slow DSL user with poor uplink speed could have a bad ping times when upload channel saturated by torrent (so everything getting horribly slow). The &quot;only&quot; problem is that it looks like if you has failed to evaluate what happens if network congestion point happens to be anywhere else and/or due to another reasons. Or that there are also other link types with other properties and issues, etc. And that except local link there are more global issues could happen. </p><p>Many routers (firewalls, IDSes, etc), especially &quot;software&quot; ones are sensitive to packets per second amount (PPS). If router&#039;s CPU is relatively weak compared to link speed, rouer could limit link&#039;s speed because router&#039;s CPU could fail to route too many packets per second. In such scenario, router performance depends on packet size. Usually, router&#039;s CPU can handle roughly some N packets per second at most and not more than that. Attempt to exceed this would lead to CPU use = 100% and dropped packets. In this case, greater packets lead to a better overall speed. Only few high-profile (and hence expensive) routers are capable of maintaining &quot;wire&quot; link speeds while dealing with small packets. So what? Simple: uTP seems to detect such scenarios as &quot;congestion&quot; as well (router starts to drop packets if there are too many of them so CPU fails to handle them in real time). And then lools like uTP reduces packets size further. This action is not smart because it does not necessarily leads to a reduced load on router&#039;s CPU (it not looks like uTP really cares about reducing PPS as well). Result? Worse up and down speeds due to router hammering with a small packets. So certain link types are known to be in trouble with uTP. Many users on torrent forums have reported that disabling uTP leads to a much better UL/DL speeds. I guess uTP should not resort to very short packets at all and rather attempt to reduce it&#039;s overall speed (actually, limiting speed of TCP-based torrent to some 80% of channel capablities is enough to get ping times and overall network behavior much better on slow DSL link). </p><p>What worse: similar effects could happen in a global scale. It looks like if some part of network as whole happens to be congested, uTP will also reduce packet sizes. First of all, this action could further degrade performance of routers/firewalls/IDSes on the way, making things even worse. Since users would start hammering them with a small packets, increasing load and further reducing achievable performance. Then, users usually still want to xfer same amount of data, but there will be more headers sent for same amount of data. So more data have to be transferred in total over network for same result. Result? Some networks were seriously jammed and some ISPs have even filtered out uTP negotiation as &quot;emergency&quot; countermeasure to keep their networks from collapsing due to huge PPSes. The primary problem is that uTP can increase PPS by 2-3 times and not each and every network equipment can easily handle this &quot;gift&quot;. And many such&#160; troubles would lead to collapse scenario when uTP would reduce packet size even further so more load so packet size goes even smaller, etc. The result Networks could run in suboptimal conditions, filled by unreasonably small packets for no reason. </p><p>IMHO, these effects should be taken into account.</p><p>jch&gt; sending maximum sized packets on Ethernet is a good idea.<br />Not exactly. Some PPTP/PPPoE or other similar links may run over Ethernet but result will have have MTU slightly less than 1500 bytes. Say, MTU of 1492 or 1488 bytes is not uncommon. Care should be taken here to avoid fragmentation on most link types and flavors.</p>]]></content>

		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuing the discussion from <a href="http://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/2338#comment:38">http://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/2338#comment:38</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jch wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><p>which can be avoided simply by layering LEDBAT over TCP</p></div></blockquote></div><p>This is the basic issue. I think you are misjudging how &quot;simple&quot; this task is. I would love to see Linux, Windows (don&#039;t forget XP, the most popular version), and OS X support LEDBAT on TCP, but the truth is we probably have years before they even think about it, and years after that before they all get it right and compatible and stable. That is assuming they want to, and I believe the hinges strongly on adoption of LEDBAT by a very large application which is in strong need of it, i.e. BitTorrent. You could go down the road of trying to implement the TCP extension yourself on each platform as some sort of filter, if that is even possible on each major OS, but you risk users not installing it due to privileges, breaking existing TCP traffic unrelated to a BitTorrent client, and generally blue screening / kernel panicing the machine.</p><p>Investing time in an albeit simplified framing layer on UDP has served us quite well for the past several years already and is available to every user on every platform. Please have a look at the source for our implementation: <a href="http://github.com/bittorrent/libutp">http://github.com/bittorrent/libutp</a> . If you can find edge cases where it performs poorly today, please point them out and/or submit patches.</p>]]></content>
