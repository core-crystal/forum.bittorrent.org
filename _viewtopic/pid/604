				<h3>Direct transfer of small files between DHT nodes</h3>
				<div class="postmsg">
					<p>First of all, I have no prior experience in designing protocols, so I am liable to make oversights or misunderstand aspects. However, this is my particular &quot;itch&quot; that I want to try scratching.<br /><br />The current DHT and Bittorrent protocols make it possible to share large files without centralisation being necessary. The metadata transfer extension (BEP-0009) also makes it possible to access these files from just a magnet link.<br />However, the Bittorrent protocol is relatively inefficient at sharing very small files (or so I understand). Normally small files are perfectly adequately distributed through http or other protocols, however these rely on centralisation. There are other p2p protocols which are more efficient at sharing small files, however many have security concerns, or are not widely used, making them currently impractical for this purpose.<br />My proposal is an extension to the DHT protocol, which allows the sharing of arbitrary small files, referenced by a unique identification name.<br /><br />I also have many more ideas for the extension and uses of this protocol, however I am presenting the basics of my idea first.<br /><br /><br />First of all, a structure for generic extensions to the DHT protocol is necessary, this can be considered a separate proposal:<br /><br />Nodes supporting any extensions add the value &quot;ext&quot;:1 into the &quot;a&quot; dictionary of their ping queries.<br />If the pinged node also supports extensions, it response adds the same &quot;ext&quot;:1 value.<br />If a response contains this value, a second ping is made with an additional value &quot;m&quot; which is a dictionary of extension names and integers, as in the Bittorrent Extension Protocol (BEP-0010).<br />The response then contains the &quot;m&quot; extension dictionary of the pinged node.<br />Additional values may also be sent along with &quot;m&quot; in this extended ping, such as those specified in BEP-0010 (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;v&quot; etc. It is important to note that a bittorrent connection to a node will not necessarily be made, so including these values is not redundant, although some of the values are already inherently redundant.)<br /><br /><br />Now, the main proposal:<br />I have chosen to name the files shared by this protocol as &quot;payloads&quot;, this may be unwise and is obviously replaceable if someone suggests a better name.<br /><br />Each payload shared by this protocol would be identified by a unique name. This is a string (preferably a unicode string, unless there is some reason this cannot be done?) of any length, containing a sensible identification name for the payload. It may be wise to further specify the format of this string for extended fuctionality, however the basic protocol does not require this. This string is then SHA-1 hashed to give a unique hash id.<br /><br />The hash id is then announced on the DHT network as if it was a torrent infohash. (I realise this means that non-supporting clients will be unable to download from this infohash, but this is unlikely, as the hash would normally only be obtained from hashing the unique name). Peers of the payload can then be acquired as with regular torrents.<br /><br />The peers returned most likely support the extension, however they should each be pinged to get their extension support information. Support for this protocol is indicated by a dictionary entry of &quot;ptransfer&quot;:1 in the &quot;m&quot; extensions dictionary.<br />(short for &quot;payload transfer&quot;, this name, and any others I use can change if there are better conventions that I am unaware of)<br /><br />Once a peer is confirmed as supporting the protocol, the following additional query can be made:<br /><br />get_pstatus:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><div class="incqbox"><h4>Code:</h4><div class="scrollbox" style="height: 12em"><pre>&quot;q&quot;:&quot;get_pstatus&quot;
&quot;a&quot;: { &quot;id&quot; : &lt;the unique name hash&gt; }

&quot;r&quot;: { &quot;id&quot; : &lt;same as above&gt;, # This is probably redundant due to transaction ids
&quot;phash&quot;: &lt;hash of the payload data&gt;,
&quot;psize&quot;: &lt;int, byte length of the payload&gt; }</pre></div></div></div><p>It is probably a good idea to try and cross-check these queries with different peers where possible.<br /><br />The payload data is split into chunks of 16KiB as with the metadata transfer protocol. Once the psize is known, the number of pieces can be worked out. Each piece can then be requested for transfer using the following query:<br /><br />get_pdata:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><div class="incqbox"><h4>Code:</h4><div class="scrollbox" style="height: 19.5em"><pre>&quot;q&quot;:&quot;get_pdata&quot;
&quot;a&quot;: { &quot;id&quot; : &lt;unique name hash&gt;,
&quot;piece&quot; : &lt;int, piece number&gt; }

&quot;r&quot;: { &quot;ack&quot; : 0 } #Request rejected

OR
&quot;r&quot;: { &quot;ack&quot; : 1, #All the remaining values are essentially redundant, but are perhaps a good idea, and add only minimal overhead
&quot;id&quot; : &lt;same name hash&gt;,
&quot;piece&quot; : &lt;same number&gt;,
&quot;size&quot; : &lt;int, byte length of chunk&gt; }</pre></div></div></div><p>Following the same structure as the metadata transfer protocol the data would be appended to the reply packet. (I am very uncertain as to whether this is practical for current DHT implementations to add support for, as it essentially breaks the current structure for DHT query/responses, feedback would be a great help here)<br /><br /><br />This is only the core structure, and I realise there are issues such as the fact multiple payloads could be shared under the same name, maliciously or indeed accidentally. I have chosen to exclude my ideas for countering this problem (and some ideas which make use of this property as a feature) from this proposal, so as to keep it as simple as possible.<br /><br />If the response to this proposal is positive, I also have ideas for building on this protocol, including signed payloads, versioned payloads, trusted node networks and inter-payload linking.<br /><br />(EDIT: While designing this, I had forgotten about the different DHT systems. This proposal is based on mainline DHT, as defined in BEP-0005, in case it was not obvious)</p>

				<h3> Re: Direct transfer of small files between DHT nodes</h3>

					<p>Well, could you provide some scenarios where it would actually be necessary to mass-distribute small files? And then i have to remind you that the DHT is operating over UDP, so it's not practical to send anymore than a few KB without implementing flow control... <br /><br />And btw, if you can post a magnet link for DHT lookups somewhere you could just post the few KB of text or whatever there too.<br /><br />So i'm not convinced of the usefulness of this proposal.</p>

				<h3> Re: Direct transfer of small files between DHT nodes</h3>
				<div class="postmsg">
					<p>In retrospect, I suppose there is actually little use for this specification on its own.<br /><br />Basically, my end goal would be to establish protocols which would utilise the swarm collecting abilites of the the DHT network to allow various kinds of centralised systems beyond file transfer (for example forums and wikis) to be hosted in a distributed network.<br />Initially I had thought to do these kind of things would require the designing of seperate networks, but after reading the specifications of the DHT network, I realised that it was so simply contrusted and scalable, that it could be easily extended for a variety of other uses.<br /><br />Of course, these ideas would only become possible with the addition of further extensions, but I wanted to keep my propsal simple, and in so doing, have made it pretty much useless...<br /><br />I think my first proposal, for a protocol to declare DHT extensions, would be very useful however, as the DHT network seems an incredibly powerful decentralised swarm collecting mechanic, which could be used for a multitude of purposes beyond the bittorrent protocol.<br />However, while I believe from my limited understanding, that the network is very scalable, I am not an expert on this at all, and I would appreciate feedback from developers about whether opening the DHT network too much could make it less useful for everyone?<br /><br />Also, should I make a seperate topic for my simpler DHT extension protocol proposal? Or just edit this one?<br /><br />Thanks for your comments nonetheless, while I realise this is a relatively slow forum, I was beginning to think I'd never get a response <img src="img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>
