				<h3>Can the protocol support growing torrents?</h3>
				<div class="postmsg">
					<p>First let me state that this idea is not ready to be considered a BEP yet, and secondly, I am not familiar enough with the protocol to know how feasible it is.&nbsp; That said, as a user of the protocol, there is a trend I see that does not have a solution yet, but I believe bittorrent is the closest to meeting it.<br /><br />Many of the torrents out there are of episodic content.&nbsp; For example, I release podcast episode 1 and provide a tracker to facilitate its download.&nbsp; Then, when episode 2 is released, I have a choice.&nbsp; Do I release a tracker for just episode 2, and make new fans download two torrents, or do I release a tracker for both episodes, giving easy access to the complete collection, essentially abandoning the first tracker?<br /><br />It would be nice to have a torrent that grows as new episodes are released.&nbsp; Say I publish a podcast and seed the first episode.&nbsp; People join the swarm and stay on as seeders.&nbsp; Then I release the second episode by growing the torrent.&nbsp; All existing seeders see the change and start downloading the new content.&nbsp; Any new members will see both episodes available for download.&nbsp; The third episode is released, and this process continues.<br /><br />The closest thing we have to this I believe is RSS feeds that kick off a torrent client to download each new episode.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, it is rare to see them fed by DHT, and older episodes have fewer seeders making it difficult for new fans to get the complete collection.<br /><br />Some thoughts:<br />1. The non-uniform distribution of pieces would have the negative consequences described in <a href="http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Sequential_downloading_is_bad." rel="nofollow">http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Sequential_downloading_is_bad.</a>&nbsp; Someone with more experience than me would need to determine just how bad that would be.<br />2. How do you control who can grow the torrent?&nbsp; Perhaps some sort of signing method is needed where the original seeder has the key, and only growths that are signed by the same key are allowed.&nbsp; Then what happens when the signer creates two growths off of the same base?<br />3. Can the mechanism used for multi-session CD-ROMs be adapted for this?&nbsp; That would allow files to be modified, replaced, or deleted by the torrent growth, but would do so only by tacking on additional sessions onto the end of the existing data.<br /><br />I believe this is technically feasible.&nbsp; The question becomes can it be done in such a way as to not break existing clients, or would it need a major revision of the protocol such that it breaks backwards compatibility?&nbsp; If so, is it worth it?</p>

				<h3> Re: Can the protocol support growing torrents?</h3>
				<div class="postmsg">
					<p>If people are using the episodic torrents PROPERLY, then the skews in piece demand that existing users cause are actually more beneficial than harmful to swarms, because individual users are resuming using existing files, causing a more rapid decentralization of supply of and demand for those pieces. Unfortunately, too many people use selective downloading instead of resuming.<br /><br />The problems caused by using selective downloading instead of resuming mean that if you are having ANY problems on such batches on my tracker, you don't get support if you selectively skipped files.<br /><br />Many groups that are releasing episodic content simply let single-file torrents fall behind as new content is released, releasing batch torrents at appropriate intervals (such as seasons for TV shows).<br /><br />Because of the way torrents are defined, you can't simply &quot;grow&quot; a torrent and have the people downloading only the first file(s) helping those on the new content.<br /><br />We've looked into it, and torrent &quot;growing&quot; ultimately can't be done in a way that doesn't break compatibility with existing clients, and the benefits aren't really worth making such a change from what I've seen.</p>

					<p>There has been a similar topic previously. The conclusion was that similar functionality could be reached through the combination of 2 features:<br />- an RSS feed that can instruct clients to remove torrents and replace them with another one <br />- clients scanning the file system for existing files that match the newly added torrent, thus re-using the old data<br /><br />This can be done without modification to the protocol or .torrent files themselves.</p>

					<p>@The 8472, so are there clients that do this?&nbsp; Has the RSS feed torrent replacement mechanism been defined (ie. same name)?&nbsp; Are there active RSS feeds using this method?<br /><br />Also, would the last file of the previous torrent still be usable when the new torrent starts downloading the piece containing the last few bytes of the existing file and the first few bytes of the newly added content?<br /><br />For example...<br />file: . . . . . . . . . . . . . episode 3 . . . . . . . . . . | <br />old torrent: . . | blk 55 . . . | blk 56 . . . | blk 57 |<br />file: . . . . . . . . . . . . . episode 3 . . . . . . . . . . | . . . . . . . . episode 4 . . . .<br />new torrent: . | blk 55 . . . | blk 56 . . . | blk 57 . . . | blk 58 . . . | blk 59 . . .<br />Would this part get downloaded again?&nbsp; |^^^^^| <br />Would the episode 3 file be usable while it was?<br />What if the new torrent has different sized pieces?<br /><br />Text explanation: Old torrent has 57 pieces, the last of which is smaller.&nbsp; New torrent has several more pieces.&nbsp; Piece 57 is larger than it was in old torrent, and its hash doesn't match what's already been written to disk, so the client clobbers the episode 3 file while reacquiring the last few bytes of the file.<br /><br />Having not written a torrent client myself, I don't know how it would work to avoid doing that.&nbsp; Perhaps you would have better insight into that.&nbsp; However, I do see that updating it via an RSS feed would automatically restart the download, regardless of the client's previous status, as I know most clients stop seeding after a while.&nbsp; Plus, I hadn't quite worked out how a growing torrent would trigger the client to start downloading again...<br /><br />Hrmmm.. thought of another potential snag.&nbsp; With the RSS/replacing client scenario, if a client chose to download just a few of the most recent episodes, but not the early ones, or if the user deleted the first few episodes after viewing them, how would the client know not to (re)download the old ones, but still download any new ones automatically?<br /><br />These issues all seem to be solvable by the client, but only if it makes some assumptions.&nbsp; The purist in me can't help but think kludge...</p>

					<p>In your example, piece 57 would be discarded and re-downloaded.<br />Episode 3 being unusable depends on how the client handles that discard.<br /><br />And yes, the delete scenario would be so kludge heavy it's not funny.</p>

					<p>No such features have been specified, the point is that they're technically feasible and can be done on the client side without extending the core protocol.<br /><br />If you want you could use something like &quot;this torrent A replaces torrents B, C, D&quot; instead of &quot;remove torrent B&quot; in the feeds. You just have to put some thought into the system to make it more elegant.<br /><br />And for the boundary pieces... unless the client zeroes out pieces that it discards it should not affect the usability of the file.<br /><br /><br />As for downloading only new ones, you can either use the selective downloading feature of the client. This is - again - merely a configuration issue.</p>

					<p>the only general solution I see is per-file hash. <br /><br />That would also resolve other problems like, move/rename/delete partial content (files) and continue seeding.</p>
