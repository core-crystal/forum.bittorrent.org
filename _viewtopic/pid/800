						<p>The last missing piece of the puzzle of decentralized torrents are scrapes.

More aggressive caching of lookup paths, lower concurrency during the lookup are starting points.&#160; <br />b) nodes can&#039;t return any seeds:peers statistics at the moment, announces would have to include flags and we&#039;d have to come up with a statistically reasonable way to add stats from multiple nodes together (i was thinking along the lines of using the similarity of small bloom filters as coincidence weights... but 1280 bytes doen&#039;t allow you to carry all that much data)</p><br /><p>So, i&#039;d just like to discuss this in general and see if anyone might come up with some shortcuts to make this reasonably efficient.

This would assume that clients who participate in the swarm announce their understanding of the number of peers and seeds.</p><p>For this particular case though, it might make more sense to have the DHT nodes that track the torrent be the authoritative source of the scrape stats, instead of having nodes that announce to it say how many seeds and peers it knows of.</p>

					<h3>Re: DHT Scrapes</h3>
					<div class="postmsg">
						<p>Well, caching node-addresses is something rather specific for high-load scenarios (like scraping 800 torrents every 30 minutes), otherwise regular, uncached lookups are preferable since the DHT piggybacks its routingtable management on them.</p><p>About torrent-statistics... i wouldn&#039;t overcomplicate things. Getting the simple case of scraping the current seed/peer count is complex enough in the DHT environment because - for large swarms - no single node will have a complete view of the entire swarm (neither DHT nodes nor peers in the swarm). While in smaller swarms each seed/peer list is almost exhaustive.<br />That&#039;s also why i&#039;m considering bloom filters as weighting. Let&#039;s say you have</p><p>DHT Node nA <br />DHT Node nB</p><p>Torrent t1 (5 seed, 10 peers)<br />Torrent t2 (100 seeds, 1000 peers)</p><br /><p>For t1 both nA and nB will contain a almost-complete, almost-identical seed/peer-lists. Thus querying the t1 seed and peer count from nA and nB cannot be added up but should be averaged instead. Or rather, they should be added together with a weight applied based on their similiarity, effectively only averaging their common nodes and adding those where they differ.</p><p>For t2 nA and nB might contain almost disjoint subsets of seed/peer lists. Thus it would make sense of adding their counts together. Again, with a weight based on similiarity so that we only (on average) add together the counts for differing peers and average those few that they share.</p><p>Since we cannot request the complete lists i think we could use bloom-filters as stand-in for the sets to compare their similarity and thus derive a weight for the addition.</p><br /><p>I&#039;m just not sure if this is actually feasible and statistically sound, especially considering that we&#039;re restricted to 1280 bytes per packet.</p>

						<p>You have to do some ordering if you don&#039;t want to run all torrents at once. There are several possible options as ranking schemes.</p><p>&quot;seeds : peers ratio&quot; allows every torrent to settle into a stable ratio, based on demand.<br />&quot;peers-seeds&quot; allows you to find the torrents the easiest to seed (private trackers)<br />&quot;seed count only, fall back to seeds : peers ratio after N seeds&quot; allows you to keep rare content alive</p><p>Anyway, any of those rules can be written in a way to avoid oscillation. But that is up to the client developers. Imo scrapes are a useful feature, not just for queueing seeds but also to gauge the liveliness of a torrent... or rather, the current phase of its lifecycle.</p>

						<p>could you please describe how old nodes which break? I still don&#039;t quite understand what you see as issue here. Routing table maintenance happens through find_node requests, not get_peers ones.</p><p>Assuming the following get_peers + announce logic:</p><p>1. send get-peers to the N (N = concurrency) closest Nodest to target key T you know<br />2. repeat step 1 until we got K (K = bucket size) value-containing responses OR the set of the closest nodes which returned a token so far does not change for N queries<br />3. send announce to the first K nodes with values+tokens we have found, if we did not find enough nodes then perform the remaining announces on the closest-set</p><p>Then storing nodes may or may not hit the &quot;core&quot; bucket around that key during their lookup. But they will only store data on<br />a) nodes that already contain data<br />b) nodes that are closer to the target than nodes in a)</p><p>alternatively nodes may use the following (more conservative) algorithm:<br />1. send get-peers to the N (N = concurrency) closest Nodest to target key T you know<br />2. repeat step 1 until the set of the closest nodes which returned a token so far does not change for N queries<br />3. send announces to the K closest nodes found so far that did return a token</p><br /><br /><p>The &quot;worst&quot; thing that could happen that the perimeter shields the closest nodes completely from incoming queries. But to achieve this a significantly <em>larger</em> set of nodes shielding them is necessary.</p><p>Which is the whole point of parameter widening... to spread load.</p><br /><br /><p>As for the path that nodes take. They do not take exactly the same path. But since XOR coordinates are always a projection onto a flat keyspace a lookup is projected onto the distance between the currently found node and the target key. Each point along the distance-projected-keyspace can only be inhabited by one node. Where the closest node to the key is the last node you&#039;ll find.</p><p>A lookup will jump along this linear keyspace in exponentially decreasing steps, only ever moving forward, closer towards the K closest nodes.</p><br /><p>The first hops will be mostly random since they&#039;ll most likely stem from the buckets spanning one half of the keyspace. But as they hop closer to the targets the routes their hops become smaller and the coincidences will increase, regardless where they come from. That in turn means that close to the target key the paths taken are mostly identical or at least have a high coincidence count.<br />The more popular a key gets the more nodes will approach the target during their lookups and more nodes will be statistically covered by the paths taken by the searching nodes. Which means more nodes near the target can perform value caching/accept stores.</p><p>And when the key isn&#039;t popular then the coincidences among the incoming paths are smaller, but in that case there should be room for all data in the closest set and perimeter widening will not be necessary anyway.</p><br /><br /><p>It is just important that nodes do at least one thing:<br />They have to keep track of who sent them tokens and do not count nodes which don&#039;t send tokens towards the K closest nodes set. This way the actual K closest nodes may refuse to store data by not sending a token and thus force store operations on slightly further away nodes.<br />This will increase the number of nodes storing the &lt;key, value&gt; pairs and allow other lookups to abort early/take load off the K closest ones.</p>

To prevent the bloom filters from overflowing a node should not send tokens once it has more than R entries under the particular key in its database. where R still has to be parametrized, together with the bloom filters.
