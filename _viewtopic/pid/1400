					<p>Continuing the discussion from <a href="http://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/2338#comment:38" rel="nofollow">http://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/2338#comment:38</a><br /></p><blockquote><div class="incqbox"><h4>jch wrote:</h4><p>which can be avoided simply by layering LEDBAT over TCP</p></div></blockquote><p>This is the basic issue. I think you are misjudging how &quot;simple&quot; this task is. I would love to see Linux, Windows (don't forget XP, the most popular version), and OS X support LEDBAT on TCP, but the truth is we probably have years before they even think about it, and years after that before they all get it right and compatible and stable. That is assuming they want to, and I believe the hinges strongly on adoption of LEDBAT by a very large application which is in strong need of it, i.e. BitTorrent. You could go down the road of trying to implement the TCP extension yourself on each platform as some sort of filter, if that is even possible on each major OS, but you risk users not installing it due to privileges, breaking existing TCP traffic unrelated to a BitTorrent client, and generally blue screening / kernel panicing the machine.<br /><br />Investing time in an albeit simplified framing layer on UDP has served us quite well for the past several years already and is available to every user on every platform. Please have a look at the source for our implementation: <a href="http://github.com/bittorrent/libutp" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/bittorrent/libutp</a> . If you can find edge cases where it performs poorly today, please point them out and/or submit patches.</p>

I am unable to say exactly how short term it is - although my estimaton of years + years earlier is probably a good one. Again, you're misjudging our specific choice to implement uTP in a more widely usable and more easily installable way as &quot;unwillingness to do things properly&quot;. You're advocating at least three pieces of software you're not even sure are possible, because it seems like &quot;the right way&quot; -- I would gladly pay your consulting fees if you had any experience implementing them. We have yet to find such a person.<br /><br />Projects like libswift ( <a href="http://libswift.org" rel="nofollow">http://libswift.org</a> ) have used LEDBAT over UDP without TCP-like in-order delivery at all. That is entirely valid, and does not require modifying the operating system's functionality with regard to TCP. Did they do things properly? I think so.</p>

					<p>While i strongly agree with the point that LEDBAT should be used as TCP congestion controller instead over yet-another-UDP-transport i want to remind people that we should cooperate here to improve things.<br /><br />Having heated arguments over each others' policies will unlikely lead to any improvement.<br /><br /><br />To be realistic here... it is a lengthy process...<br /><br />If we want to push LEDBAT to microsoft/linux/osx it first has to be standardized, i.e. the RFC needs to be finalized. Once that has happened we'd need someone to write a linux kernel module (since getting the kernel devs to accept it is probably the easiest way) including TCP socket parameters for controlling it... which BT Inc probably has little interest in since they mostly write for windows at the moment.<br /><br />Once that has happend we could knock on apple's and microsoft's doors.<br /><br /><br />Of course some of these steps could be started prepared of time, if anyone is willing to do so.</p>
