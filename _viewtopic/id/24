						<p>There are some tactical issues with defaulting to 3+1 as someone with e.g. 10Mbit/s up could push 2.5Mbit per upload slot. Many domestic connection are capable of absorbing that kind of upload (and thus the &#039;increase # of upload slots&#039;-rule won&#039;t kick in), but they are not able to reciprocate properly. In a swarm full of peers with 1Mbit upload (which results in 250kbit/s per slot according to the 3+1 rule) a single 10Mbit peer is better off by splitting his bandwidth to 250kbit/s too, since a single peer would not be able to match a slot bandwidth of 2.5Mbit, but 10 times the amount of slots means that he&#039;ll get tons of peers that can match his bandwidth and thus result in better download performance.</p><p>This is scenario is very real in swarms with only a few 100 peers / seeds or less where it&#039;s hard to find good matches. On a swarm with 10k peers a 10Mbit/s up peer will eventually find his equal.</p><br /><p>In short: it&#039;s not in the user&#039;s interest to stick to very low amount of upload slots as long as there are many slower peers around.<br />This is one of the reasons why i added symmetric connections to the home to my list.</p><br /><p>-------------</p><br /><p>About P4P and biased neighbor selection. I don&#039;t consider the P4P simulation/tests as realistic, testing bittorrent and locality on the Abilene network is like testing carriages with rockets...<br />Locality-awareness generally is not worth much (from the user-perspective) mostly because bittorrent is not latency-sensitive, thus it comes down to throughput. Since all local peers will have similar throughputs <em>any</em> remote peer that&#039;s faster will beat them... and be it a lone, co-located seedbox in australia.</p><br /><p>If the PoP or a shared network resources to the PoP is congested (which is often the case with cable providers, due to an infrastructure that wasn&#039;t designed for bidirectional, unshared usage) then there&#039;s almost nothing we can do about it, at least nothing that would preserve performance. Unless we consider things like multicast</p><p>If the backbone or peering infrastructure is so heavily congested that it even degrades P2P performance then seeking out local peers might ease the load and improve user-perceived performance.</p><p>If one of N peering points are congested and rerouting P2P traffic through the other N-1 peering links would be too expensive then somethink like P4P signaling the clients that a specific set of IP ranges should be avoided <em>if possible</em> then clients might be able to bias their selections away from those ranges, especially if they already are at their configured upload / download speed limits.</p><br /><p>The problem in general is that most measures that reduce the load on the ISP do not translate into better speeds for the enduser, as all current mechanisms in bittorrent already are rigged toward best throughput, deviating from those significantly has a high chance of degrading that performance, unless measures are taken to make deviating from current practice more attractive.</p><br /><br /><p>QBone&#039;s scavenger service basically sounds like what a <em>proper</em> traffic shaping solution should have done all along. Lumping all p2p traffic together, allocate it to a &quot;bulkier&quot; category and let the p2p connections compete internally for the bandwidth that&#039;s left over from the &quot;bulk&quot; traffic. The problem here is that home routers potentially mess with the TOS (diffserv) fields, IP stacks don&#039;t allow manipulation and all this could have been implemented by traffic shaping hardware all along (they could just tag all TCP streams and alter the IP header), but this was not the case. I don&#039;t know much how many routers actually honor diffserv and to what extent, so more background information on this topic would be necessary.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>For example two topics frequently come up with ISPs:</p><p>- congestion in parts of the network that cannot cost effectively or quickly <br />&#160; be upgraded to fiber (ripping up streets, obtaining rights of way).<br />- minimizing transit traffic.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>Well, as explained above it all depends on where exactly the problems are. I guess a small ISP serving via DSL has other issues than a large cable provider. And european ISPs probably don&#039;t have to fear transit traffic due to very extensive peering agreements (just look at the <a href="https://www.ams-ix.net/connected/?expanded=1&amp;showip=1">AMS-IX</a>, <a href="http://www.de-cix.net/content/clients.html">DE-CIX</a> and <a href="https://www.linx.net/about/member_ipasn.html">LINX</a> member listings and their throughput [<a href="http://www.ams-ix.net/technical/stats/">1</a>,<a href="http://www.de-cix.net/content/network/Traffic-Statistics.html">2</a> and <a href="https://www.linx.net/pubtools/trafficstats.html?stats=day">3</a>]).</p><p>The point is, we need more information to base decisions on, and from more than just 1 ISP.</p>

But there are only ~9 of them in the world. All other big ISPs are tier 2, i.e. they peer with other ISPs but also buy transit. It&#039;s the extent ot peering that varies. And i&#039;d say we have a pretty good peering infrastructure here. But this is only an observation from publicly available statistics. But yeah, it would be best to hear it from various ISPs.</p>

						<p>i would be careful with connecting locally, as this might lead to significant clustering, especially on larger torrents. a correct choice of peers to connect to is an important part of the way PEX should operate, the worst case would be a disjoint subgraph when the tracker is down.<br />That&#039;s why i said you can only apply randomized optimizations.</p><p>And it still requires a way to estimate the distance in advance of connecting to them.</p>

						<p>Clustering causes issues beyond swarm fragmentation. It also influences the distribution of newly available pieces between the subgraphs and thus can be detrimal to piece picking, especially if the local availability value is rather low, which is even the case on big swarms if the peer churn is high (hit-and-running, many new nodes arriving due to the popularity of the content).</p><p>I&#039;ve seen significant availability hotspots building even in randomly connected swarms, I&#039;d say this would get worse with clustering.</p><p>I have written a view for empirical analysis of the piece distribution, which might be useful for testing this kind of stuff: <a href="http://infinite-source.de/az/pieceDist.jpeg"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://infinite-source.de/az/pieceDist.jpeg" alt="pieceDist.jpeg" /></span></a><br />In my experience a near-optimal piece-distribution looks like an Erlang-distribution with a mean close to the middle of the blue area, i.e. mean = (availability - seedcount) / 2</p>
