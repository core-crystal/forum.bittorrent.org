				<h3>Further developing private torrents</h3>
				<div class="postmsg">
					<p>Hi,<br /><br />Consider the scenario where I'd like to distribute sensitive data to a bunch of people over a totally unsecure network (sniffing paranoia, etc) but using a controlled tracker.<br /><br />I obviously haven't lurked enough around here; feel free to stop me immediately - but from what I already understand, there's no guarantee regarding security at all.&nbsp; Current solution seems to satisfy only big trackers performance needs and private communities minimum control requirements over very large swarms.<br /><br />Here I'd like to discuss scenarios involving small (private) trackers (personal ones?) and greatly restrained and restricted swarms.&nbsp; Is that in the scope of these forums?<br /><br /><br /><br />If so, I'd like to emit a very simple idea.&nbsp; The goal is to force authentication with the tracker for every peer wanting to use the torrent, while limiting the &quot;traitors&quot; abilities to infiltrate strangers in the swarm.<br /><br />Why not assigning a secret per peer in the tracker's list?<br /><br />A global secret has obvious disadvantages (requires the tracker to push its update to every peer at once; allows an unregistered hacker to download from every peer in the swarm until the next update -and beyond- if there's a leak, etc.)<br /><br />Here, no additional transaction is needed.&nbsp; In fact, we're just fixing the fact that IPs are no longer the secret by appending an actual secret in the records.&nbsp; It doesn't have to be some user input, the client could regenerate it even if it's not actually necessary.&nbsp; You'll be the only one challenging with it.&nbsp; Note that we thus need encryption to transfer it.<br /><br />Alright let's get to the basics.<br />A is seeding; both B and C may have the torrent and want the files, B is cool and registered, C is not.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; B has the torrent and connects to the tracker, auth, then receives A's address with her secret.&nbsp; He can now connect to A using it.<br />2.&nbsp; C won't get the address nor the secret of A from the tracker, so the torrent is almost useless.&nbsp; He however manages to get A's address and knows for sure she's seeding the files (again, this is pure theory in worst context).&nbsp; Currently, he could say hello to her and she would be seeding him the files without further checking, is that correct?&nbsp; Now, he would be challenged with the secret, which he can only get from the tracker or leakers.<br /><br />The next step is to push the negociation further by involving the tracker more actively (at higher cost than 'just' secrets space overhead in its records).&nbsp; We could ask the user a PK that has to be signed by the tracker, which could then sign and encrypt the secret to secure it better (and we're down to the same thing everytime - the web of trust can help identify the user here).<br /><br />Ultimately, the challenger could sync with the tracker and provide him with a custom secret for each request (maybe we want a separate auth server for that?)&nbsp; I'm thinking OAuth without a lot of reading about it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for reading.&nbsp; Please don't take this too seriously, I'm really just letting ideas fly here; but if there's some discussion catching up here I'd be happy to contribute, even if it has very low priority.</p>
