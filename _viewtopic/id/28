vulnerability.</p><p>Freeloading is possible in BitTorrent because fundamentally all P2P (peer-to-peer) involves a trade (share) of data.&#160; As each chunk of a file is traded, one peer has to go first and trust that the other peer will reciprocate. </p><p>There is nothing in the fundamental protocol of the internet (TCP/IP or UDP) that enables two peers to guarantee both peers will send and assure mutual receipt.&#160; In fact, it would not be possible, because the routers implementing the internet protocols are themselves peers, and thus could void any such guarantee.&#160; The internet is robust precisely because the fundamental protocols can handle high rates of failure (packet loss).</p><p>Peers may fail to reciprocate due to network issues, but this is not a vulnerability, rather just a normal requirement for robust load balancing.&#160; Also peers might contain programming errors, but the motivation would be to fix these over time (one would assume the most popular clients would fit the motivation of the market).&#160; Thus, other than an intent to be malicious, the only possible reason a peer would not reciprocate, is the economic cost of reciprocating (of uploading it&#039;s chunk of the file).</p><p>My idea is peers then trade an encrypted file chunk, then acknowledge receipt by trading the decryption strings.&#160; Thus, no peer has a bandwidth economic motivation to not trade the file chunks, as before they can use the chunk they received, they must send an equal size chunk.&#160; The decryption strings are so small relative to the file chunks, that the peers have no bandwidth economic motivation to not trade them.</p><p>I do not know if this has already been proposed else where?</p><br /><p>2) So the above idea, removes the need for money (micro-payments) in the case where like-files are being traded (i.e. in the BitTorrent type of swarm P2P).</p><br /><p>3) The above idea does not stop malicious vulnerabilities, motivated by external economics.&#160; I will be addressing this in a future post.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>=========================================<br />Why BitTorrent is important &amp; implications of &quot;malicious&quot;<br />=========================================</p><p>Many people probably associate P2P with illegal activities, e.g. sharing copyrighted data.</p><p>However, P2P (peer-to-peer) will be incredibly economically important for the internet to grow at it&#039;s maximum possible exponential growth rate.</p><p>The current C/S (client-server) method of internet publishing, places the upload cost on the publisher, not on the consumer.&#160; This has proliferated the advertising business model (i.e. in one word &quot;Google&quot;), in order for the publisher to recapture the upload cost.&#160; This places economy-of-scale hurdles (granularity limits) on publishing.&#160; This is a centralization creep paradigm due to the motivation of economy-of-scale, which conflicts with the paradigm of exponential disordered growth via the 0 cost hyperlink, which forms the basis of the WWW (world wide web).</p><p>In short, the Entropy of the universe is trending to maximum, the 0 cost hyperlink is a radical mass-busting (Entropy accelerating) paradigm, but the economy-of-scale economic paradigm of C/S will work against diffusion of mass (free market).&#160; Realize that I have shown else where that knowledge is gained by the free market as the number of actors and interactions increases (i.e. as the Entropy increases):</p><p><a href="http://www.coolpage.com/commentary/economic/shelby/Mass-Entropy_Equivalence.html">http://www.coolpage.com/commentary/econ … lence.html</a></p><p>The problem of upload cost applies when a file is popular.&#160; BitTorrent is a form of P2P that focuses on sharing like-files, where since there are many downloaders of the same file, then the downloaders can also be the uploaders.&#160; Thus the upload cost is shared by the downloaders, and not a cost of the publisher.</p><p>Afaik, up to now no one had solved the problem of potential freeloading vulnerabilities on P2P.&#160; I had reached the theoretical conclusion after deep study in 2006 that no open P2P network could prevent bandwidth economically motivated freeloading, unless it used some form of real money micro-payments.&#160; And I do not think users would ever agree to be prompted for micro-payment confirmation every time they click a download link.&#160; However, when trading chunks of the same file, the data itself is common money, but the problem remained how to guarantee the escrow, so trade is completed by both peers.&#160; I think I have now solved that issue as detailed above.</p><p>However, I can see no way for the P2P protocol to prevent malicious intent.&#160; Fortunately, I do not think malicious intent is a viable threat, because clients are motivated to defend their network.&#160; Usually in society, this means that most people choose to use an &quot;obedient&quot; client, because absent a selfish economic benefit, then Pareto Efficiency applies:</p><p><a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/bittorrentecon.pdf">http://www.bittorrent.org/bittorrentecon.pdf</a><br />(see section 3.1 on page 4)</p><p>Pareto Efficiency explains why only about 2.5% of the population is criminal.</p><p>Even if the entire society became criminal, then a sub-society could form it&#039;s own private P2P network using the same protocols, such as by using a secure username and password with a credit card for identification on signup.&#160; However, I do not think such private networks will be required, because society as a whole is Pareto Efficient.</p>

						<p>I&#039;d appreciate if you&#039;d be more concise and less philosophical. I&#039;m also not quite sure if you understand how bittorrent works. Bittorrent already does enforce reciprocity where it is necessary, i.e. when there is no surplus of bandwidth. In a swarm w/o seeds (i.e. only peers) the unchoking alogrithms will punish freeriding significantly and fast uploaders will download faster. Freeriding is only possible when there&#039;s a surplus of bandwidth, which means it&#039;s less of an issue (although still an annoyance).</p><p>You also used a rather old implementation (the python mainline client), more advanced clients are more sophisticated when it comes to their swarm behavior, so i suggest you retest with Azureus or ÂµTorrent. And if you compare uploading vs. not-uploading you also have to consider that uncapped upload will lead to worse TCP performance, that&#039;s why the general advise is to upload at ~80% of the line&#039;s upload capacity.</p><p>And assuming you have a fast line then clients also need tweaking of various settings, including upload slots. So i&#039;d say your comparison is not entirely practical.</p><p>Oh, and you also said that TCP overhead would be significant for 500 connections or so... nobody claims that. the HAVE messages combined with TCP overhead are the issue.</p><br /><p>Ah, i finally found the point of your post, and yes... this has been proposed before:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>My idea is peers then trade an encrypted file chunk, then acknowledge receipt by trading the decryption strings.&#160; Thus, no peer has a bandwidth economic motivation to not trade the file chunks, as before they can use the chunk they received, they must send an equal size chunk.&#160; The decryption strings are so small relative to the file chunks, that the peers have no bandwidth economic motivation to not trade them.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>This comes down to a block based tit-for-tat instead of rate based tit-for-tat, something that has been tried in the past (one of the earliest python bittorrent clients) but worked horribly and thus was dropped. And i don&#039;t see how it would solve the seed/optimistic unchoke freeriding.</p>

						<p>Thanks for reading.</p><p>Rather than use only a systemic goal of upload bandwidth as a limit, noting that I&#039;ve read in your forums that in general unbalanced upload usage is causing throttling by ISPs such as Comcast, I am proposing that you can specifically incentivize reciprocity on each exchange of data with a fairly straightforward change to the protocol as follows.&#160; I realize this would require all clients to change, or maybe this idea can be used for a new competitor to BitTorrent&#039;s protocol:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>My idea is peers then trade an encrypted file chunk, then acknowledge receipt by trading the decryption strings.&#160; Thus, no peer has a bandwidth economic motivation to not trade the file chunks, as before they can use the chunk they received, they must send an equal size chunk.&#160; The decryption strings are so small relative to the file chunks, that the peers have no bandwidth economic motivation to not trade them.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>Also note that I view that systemic choking as vulnerable as long as there is an economic incentive to not upload on each exchange of a file chunk.&#160; You really won&#039;t know how vulnerable it is until you get mainstream commercial usage and there is enough incentive for rogue clients to emerge in popularity.&#160; If there is no economic incentive, then Pareto Efficiency concludes that rogue clients won&#039;t achieve popularity.</p><p>Apologies if I am missed something important, and I will note your clarification if I so agree.</p><p>Btw, my interest in this is because I would like to see BitTorrent-like protocol eventually enabled for all links on the WWW, via a browser plugin.&#160; This is something I would like to see for a highly disordered project I am developing to compete with OpenSocial, MySpace, FaceBook, etc..&#160; This will hopefully be my encore to my CoolPage.com.</p><br /><p>Oh I see you were editing your post while I was replying:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>This comes down to a block based tit-for-tat instead of rate based tit-for-tat, something that has been tried in the past (one of the earliest python bittorrent clients) but worked horribly and thus was dropped.

All freeriding on bittorrent happens due to optimistic unchokes and seeds and not due to the non-optimistic chokes. If you&#039;re saying we should remove optimistic unchokes then this is not practical since we have to randomly try peers to see if the reciprocate. block based reciprocation would also leave bandwidth unused in case a peer with a fast upload could not find his equals. Optimistic unchokes are also necessary to randomize the global set of active connections and provide initial data to peers w/o explicitly providing data to peers that appear to be new, pieceless peers, otherwise one could exploit generosity towards new peers by not signaling any pieces. </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>Could you point me to a resource which discusses this in more detail.&#160; What was the context, what didn&#039;t work, why didn&#039;t it work, etc?</p></div></blockquote></div><p>No, this was discussed on IRC a while ago and i barely remember it, ofc nobody writes whitepapers based on IRC discussions.

					<h3>Re: Improve BitTorrent to prevent economically motivated freeloading</h3>
					<div class="postmsg">
						<p>Your astute restatement of my proposed algorithm appears to accurate and easy-to-understand, with one exception.&#160; I did not propose the bulk exchange of keys, but that may not be (for future contemplation) a central issue to the algorithm.&#160; You also astutely stated that non-malicious users would lose economic incentive to not upload.&#160; Also note that my proposal is &quot;economically complete&quot; in simplicity, meaning there are no economically motivated loopholes, such as the BitTyrant exploit of the &quot;unchoking&quot; which you mentioned.</p><p>Thus BitTorrent&#039;s systemic &quot;unchoking&quot; algorithm becomes unnecessary, unless one assumes there is a beneficial optimization from asymmetric down/upload bandwidth per peer and/or per ISP.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>What you are proposing does provide a strict improvement in the case for users that derive maximal utility from not sending, and this would be the case for anyone forced into usage-based billing for uplink capacity where the usage price is higher than the value derived from downloading faster.&#160; &#160;</p><p>If my assessment of your proposal is correct then this has little value in the United States.&#160; It however might be valuable in other countries.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>My understanding is the &quot;unchoking&quot; algorithm attempts to maximize global bandwidth, with download = upload globally, but this comes at the cost of asymmetric down/upload bandwidth per peer and/or per ISP.</p><p>It appears your assumption is that flat rate billing implies that upload and download costs are symmetric.&#160; Let me explain how my logic is derived from &quot;usage price is higher than the value derived from downloading faster&quot;.</p><p>With flat rate billing, the user is motivated to download up to his download bandwidth limit.&#160; The user pays nothing extra for the upload bandwidth.&#160; If the ISP has priced their flat rate service based on the predominant C/S (non-P2P) model of the internet, then the ISP may be assuming a global say 10% upload-to-download bandwidth ratio.&#160; If the network does not behave according to the pricing model of the ISP, then the ISP will either have to absorb the economic losses, modify the pricing, or throttle the offending network traffic.</p><p>Thus, I think my proposal applies in the United States and every where, irregardless if the user is currently billed for upload bandwidth.&#160; Just because a cost is hidden behind flat rate pricing, does not mean the cost does not exist.</p><p>Asymmetric down/upload bandwidth per peer means that ISPs which offer more flat rate upload bandwidth, will be subsidizing those ISPs which offer less flat rate upload bandwidth.&#160; So &quot;unchoking&quot; will economically force the upload cost to be priced out to the user over time, and thus in the end you will either get symmetric networks or you will get severe throttling.&#160; Over the long-term, there is no way to avoid the free market effect that everyone must ultimately pay for the costs they use.</p><p>My understanding is the underlying cost of full-duplex communications, means that the upload uses a portion of the frequency band of the wire, and thus upload is not free:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#Frequency_division_duplex">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(te … ion_duplex</a></p><br /><p>---Add---</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>Assumption: user utility is an increasing function of download rate.</p><p>Without your proposed mechanism, each non-malicious user is still motivated to send as fast as possible (at least in the absence of knowledge of how fast other peers are sending*), since sending faster increases the probability of staying within the neighboring peer&#039;s unchoked set</p></div></blockquote></div><p>I implied the following, but let me make it explicit.</p><p>Although the user is motivated to download at his maximum download speed, the ISP has an economic motivation to limit the peer&#039;s upload capacity to the predominant pricing model, thus the peer has no choice but to leech on &quot;optimistic unchokes&quot; and the network ends up asymmetric.&#160; This economic motivation is a form of socialism, where everyone loses over the long-term, as more ISPs will be motivated to throttle to their pricing model, because of the &quot;unchoking&quot; which desires to maximize global leeching to &quot;share costs&quot; and not have the costs paid by those who need the extra speed.</p><br /><p>---Add #2---</p><p>Clients could do &quot;optimistic unchoking&quot; in my proposed protocol, by simply sending the key even if they did not receive the reciprocated data.&#160; So the free market could decide which type of client is the winner.&#160; The protocol should be agnostic and maximally generalized.</p><p>---Add #3---</p><p>ISPs beginning to monetize excessive bandwidth useage that deviates significantly from their per-user average bandwidth cost business model:</p><p><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/comcasts-near-unlimited-bandwidth-limits/">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/0 … th-limits/</a></p>
